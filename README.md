# CreditCardFraudDetection

â€”In order to solve credit fraud detection under card not-present scenario, this project investigate two ML algorithm
to build credit detection models: Logistic Model and Random Forest. Compared with existent literature work, four
random sampling techniques are applied to solve imbalance dataset problem and utilize multiple accuracy rates
to evaluate model performance other than relying on single criteria of accuracy.
